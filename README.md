# Selene Static Builder

A rather small static site builder built from Twig and MArkdown that isn't blog centric.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Composer
Yarn
PHP 7.2+

```
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

composer create-project selenesoftware/seleneSite

```
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
I don't have tests for this.  It is so small, tests would seem larger than the actual code.  Don't want that.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

## Deployment

Once you run bin/app.php there will be files created in the 'web' directory.  Then run yarn build and you have production ready files.  Drop everything in the 'web' directory into your production environment.
