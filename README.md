SeleneSoftware.us
================

These are the Spress files for selenesoftware.us.  It has all the content and all the good things in it.  I haven't had time to build this for a CDN, or build a proper contact form, but here is the page.

# Installation
If you don't have Spress, you aren't working on a site in Selene Software.  Download it at http://spress.yosymfony.com and install it.  Once you have that, run composer (http://getcomposer.org) and point your web server to look at the _site directory.
